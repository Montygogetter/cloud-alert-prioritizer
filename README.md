# Cloud Alert Prioritizer â€“ AI with NLP, Classification, Search, and Symbolic Reasoning

This project simulates an AI-driven alert analyzer for cloud operations. It classifies alert severity using NLP and logistic regression, prioritizes them using best-first search, and applies first-order logic rules to recommend escalation, suppression, or closure actions.

## ðŸ§  Key Features

- ðŸ”¹ Natural Language Processing using TF-IDF
- ðŸ”¹ Logistic Regression classifier with class balancing
- ðŸ”¹ Best-First Search heuristic using urgency and system weighting
- ðŸ”¹ First-Order Logic rules for symbolic decision-making
- ðŸ”¹ CSV output for top 10 ranked alerts with automated decisions

## ðŸ“‚ Files

- `CSC510_Module8_PortfolioProject_Code_AI_AlertAnalyzer_Jessica_Montgomery.py` â€“ full implementation
- `top_10_with_fol_decisions.csv` â€“ sample output showing alert decisions

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Place your expanded alert dataset as `alert_dataset_expanded.csv` in the same directory
2. Run:
```bash
python CSC510_Module8_PortfolioProject_Code_AI_AlertAnalyzer_Jessica_Montgomery.py
